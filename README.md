Power bi dashboard

Conquered Credit Card Analysis with Power BI! Excited to share my latest project: a credit card financial dashboard built with Power BI! This project helped me gain valuable insights into spending patterns and customer behavior. Here's a breakdown of the steps I took:

Data Wrangling: wrangled data from CSV files into a SQL database, then connected that database to Power BI for seamless data access.

Power Up with Power Query: transformed and cleaned the data in Power Query Editor, ensuring it was ready for analysis.

The Magic of DAX: created new columns and insightful measures using DAX functions, unlocking the power of the data.

Dual Dashboards for Double Insights: built two distinct dashboards:

Credit Card Transaction Report: Detailed analysis of transaction volume, types, amounts, and trends. Credit Card Customer Report: Customer demographics, spending behavior, credit limits, and targeted insights. 5. Visualization Powerhouse: Packed each dashboard with charts, KPIs, and other visuals to make the data sing!
